"""Regression test: pgduck_server crash during WaitForResult must not crash PostgreSQL.

Before the fix, WaitForResult called ReleasePGDuckConnection() before
re-throwing the error when PQconsumeInput() returned false (broken
connection).  The PG_FINALLY block in the FDW scan then called
ReleasePGDuckConnection() a second time on the same (already freed or
reused) hash entry, causing a double-free and SIGSEGV in the backend
— which crashed the whole PostgreSQL cluster.

The fix removes the premature ReleasePGDuckConnection call from
WaitForResult so connection lifetime is always managed exclusively by the
caller's PG_FINALLY block.

The test uses the 'pgduck-wait-for-result' injection point (in the
WaitForResult poll loop in client.c) to pause a backend after it has sent
a query to pgduck_server but before it calls PQconsumeInput().  The test
kills pgduck_server while the backend is paused, then wakes it.
PQconsumeInput() detects the broken connection and throws an ERROR.  With
the fix the error propagates cleanly; without the fix the backend
SIGSEGV-crashes the entire PostgreSQL instance.
