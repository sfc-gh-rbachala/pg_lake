 * Behavior for out-of-range or unsupported values during writes to Iceberg
 * data files.
 *
 * Applies to:
 *   - Temporal columns (date, timestamp, timestamptz): values beyond
 *     the Iceberg-supported range are clamped or rejected.
 *   - Bounded numeric columns: NaN values are clamped to NULL or rejected.
 *   - Array columns: multidimensional arrays are clamped to NULL or
 *     rejected (error), since PostgreSQL's single array type (e.g. int[])
 *     maps to a flat LIST(T) in DuckDB/Iceberg.
 *
 * Controlled by the out_of_range_values table option (default: error).
 *
 * CLAMP silently adjusts values (e.g. year 10000 becomes 9999-12-31,
 * NaN becomes NULL, multidimensional arrays become NULL).
 * ERROR raises an error instead.
 * NONE skips validation entirely (used for non-Iceberg tables).
